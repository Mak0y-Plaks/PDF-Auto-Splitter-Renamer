# PDF Auto Split + (batch) Rename
.py script for pdf auto splitting and auto page-by-page renaming

---Coded using Python 3.7 with PyPDF2 and package-freezed by PyInstaller as a stand-alone executable for Windows

Specifically developed for the later part of Philippine National Police's Finance Service's approach to offline mass archiving of scanned individual tax forms filed by personnel collected separately, then sorted, bundled and submitted mainly by provincial/city/regional headquarter Finance Sergeants.

Coding was focused only on extracting or copying every page from a (read-access only) pdf doc and subsequently renaming each copied page with the use of a list of strings appended from either manual CLI input() or multiple text input() from clipboard.


Disclaimer and request for ideas for future development:

Since this is just my very first attempt at having a GUI for the office-automation-problem-to-code solution I have been able to come up with so far, any comment, suggestions, contribution, expert advice is welcome.

I have no programming background other than basic Python and I'm still getting my head around adding class functions into my scripts, so please be nice. :)
