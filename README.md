# pdf_auto_splitter_renamer
.py script for pdf splitting and page-by-page renaming

---Coded using Python 3.7 


Specifically developed for the later part of Philippine National Police's Finance Service's approach to the mass archiving of individual tax forms filed by personnel.

Coding focused only on extracting or copying every page from a pdf doc(read-access only) and subsequently renaming each copied page with the use of a list of strings appended from either manual input() or multiple text input() from clipboard.

Since this is just my very first attempt at having a GUI for the office automation problem-to-code solution I have been able to come up with so far, any comment, suggestions, contribution, expert advice is welcome.

Credits to the developers of Python and lib/modules tkinter, PyPDF2 and pyinstaller.
