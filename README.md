# PDF Auto Split + (batch) Rename
.py script for pdf auto splitting and auto page-by-page renaming

---Coded using Python 3.7 


Specifically developed for the later part of Philippine National Police's Finance Service's approach to offline mass archiving of scanned individual tax forms filed by personnel.

Coding focused only on extracting or copying every page from a pdf doc(read-access only) and subsequently renaming each copied page with the use of a list of strings appended from either manual input() or multiple text input() from clipboard.

Since this is just my very first attempt at having a GUI for the office automation problem-to-code solution I have been able to come up with so far, any comment, suggestions, contribution, expert advice is welcome.

I have no programming background other than basic Python and I'm still getting my head around injecting classes into my scripts, so please be nice. :)
