# pdf_auto_splitter_renamer
.py script for pdf splitting and page-by-page renaming

---Coded using Python 3.7 


Specifically developed for Philippine National Police's Finance Service's perusal.

Coding focused only on extracting or copying every page from a pdf doc(read-access only) and subsequently renaming each page with the use of a list of strings from either manual input() or multiple text input() from clipboard.

Credits to the developers of Python and the lib/modules tkinter, PyPDF2 and pyinstaller.
